# *Vue i18n Ally* is now **i18n Ally**!

This extension is now come to v1.x stage! From v1.x, we make it not limited to support Vue but other frameworks such as React.js, Angular and more all in one extension!

2. Uninstall the old `Vue i18n Ally`.
3. You are done. ðŸŽ‰

Configurations are backward compatible. And all the features for Vue will work as it would do.

## New Features
